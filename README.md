# CheckYouLater-React
Simple React app to save bookmarks

This is the React part of a simple MERN app that I created. You can visit https://www.checkyoulater.org/ to see how it works.

If you wanna see how it works in the backend, you may check https://github.com/yigittheearthwalker/CheckYouLater-NodeJS

It uses Firebase for Authentication and MongoDB for database so to try it out on your localhost please do not forget to make these configurations
